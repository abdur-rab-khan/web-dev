| 🟡 Array is a special type of object used to store ordered collections of values. Arrays in JavaScript are dynamic, meaning they can grow and shrink      |
|    in size.                                                                                                                                               | 
|                                                                                                                                                           |
| 🟡 In Javascript, Array can store multiple data types including primitive and non-primitive types.                                                        |
|                                                                                                                                                           |
| 🟡 Javascript also provide typed arrays to store specific data types like Int8Array, Float32Array, etc.                                                   |
|                                                                                                                                                           |

| 🟡 Map is a collection of key-value pairs where keys can be of any data type. It maintains the order of insertion and allows for efficient retrieval of   |
|    values based on their keys.                                                                                                                            |
|                                                                                                                                                           |
| 🟡 Set is a collection of unique values, meaning it does not allow duplicate entries. It is useful for storing distinct items and performing set          |
|    operations like union, intersection, and difference.                                                                                                   |
|                                                                                                                                                           |
| 🟡 WeakMap is similar to Map but with weakly held keys, meaning that if there are no other references to a key object, it can be garbage collected.       |
|                                                                                                                                                           |
| 🟡 WeakSet is similar to Set but with weakly held objects, meaning that if there are no other references to an object in the WeakSet, it can be garbage   |
|    collected. weakmap, weakset are commonly used in dom manipulation to prevent memory leaks.                                                             |

| 🟡 In Javascript, coercion is a process of converting a value from one data type to another. Coercion can be implicit (automatic) or explicit (manual).   |
|                                                                                                                                                           |
| 🟡 Javascript does not perform coercion randomly, it follows specific rules to determine when and how to coerce values based on the context of the        | 
|     operation.                                                                                                                                            |

|    2️⃣. If left and right operands are number, it performs addition.                                                                                       |
|                                                                                                                                                           |
| 🔵 With other Math operators (-, *, /, %, <, >, <=, >=)                                                                                                   |
|                                                                                                                                                           |
|    1️⃣. It converts both operands to number type and performs the operation.                                                                               |
|    2️⃣. If not possible to convert, it results in NaN.                                                                                                     |
|                                                                                                                                                           |
| 🔵 With Comparison operators (==, !=):                                                                                                                    | 
|                                                                                                                                                           |
|   1️⃣. It converts both operands to same type and then performs the comparison.                                                                            |
|   2️⃣. If one operand is boolean, other operand is converted to number (true -> 1, false -> 0) before comparison.                                          | 
|                                                                                                                                                           |
| 🔵 With Logical operators (&&, ||, !) or (if, while, for):                                                                                                |
|                                                                                                                                                           |
|   1️⃣. It converts operands to boolean type and then performs the operation.                                                                               |
|                                                                                                                                                           |
| 🔵 With === and !== operators:                                                                                                                            |
|                                                                                                                                                           |
|  1️⃣. No coercion is performed, it checks both value and type for equality/inequality.                                                                     |
|                                                                                                                                                           |
| ⭐ Note: Checking in Javascript is always run from left to right, so the first operand type is considered for coercion rules.                             |
| ⭐ Note: Objects are compared by reference, not by value. Two different objects with identical properties are considered unequal.                         |
| ⭐ Note: Always use === and !== or if NaN check is required use Object.is() method to avoid unexpected coercion results.                                  |
