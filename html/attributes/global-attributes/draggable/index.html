    HTML Draggable is an global attribute that indicates whether an element is draggable or not, or native drag-and-drop behavior.

    "draggable" can have the following values:
      - true: The element is draggable.
      - false: The element is not draggable.

    - It is enumerate not a boolean attribute.

    - By using this user may select draggable elements with a mouse, drag those elements and drop by releasing it.

    ================== CONCEPTS ==================

    - Drag and drop has three distinct use cases:
      1. Drag and drop within a web page (e.g., rearranging items in a list).
      2. Drag and drop between web pages (e.g., dragging an image from one page to another).
      3. Drag and drop between a web page and the desktop (e.g., dragging a file from the desktop into a web application).

    ================= JAVASCRIPT ==================

    1. Drag and Drop Events
        - dragstart: Fired when the user starts dragging an element.
        - drag: Fired when the element is being dragged.
        - dragend: Fired when the user releases the mouse button to drop the element.
        - dragenter: Fired when a draggable element enters a drop target.
        - dragover: Fired when a draggable element is being dragged over a drop target.
        - dragleave: Fired when a draggable element leaves a drop target.
        - drop: Fired when a draggable element is dropped on a drop target.

    ============== DRAGGABLE ITEMS ==============

    - Default default, "images", "links" and "selections" are draggable.
    - To make element draggable set "draggable='true'".
    - Once text or other element become draggable it no longer be selected, use "Alt" to select.
    

    ============== DRAG DATA STORE ==============

    - We can't transfer JavaScript objects directly, So to transfer data in and out of thee webpages we use "DataTransfer" object.
    - It provide object which use during "drag and drop" and "clipboard" operations to hold the data being moved.
    - It's temporary carriers the data for drag and drop actions.

    <=====> METHODS <=====>

    1. clearData(format)
        - It used to clear the data stored in the "DataTransfer" object.
        - If no format is specified, all data is cleared.

    2. getData(format)
        - It used to retrieve the data of the specified format from the "DataTransfer" object.

    3. setData(format, data)
        - It used to add data of the specified format to the "DataTransfer" object.

    4. setDragImage(image, x, y)
        - It used to set a custom image to be used during the drag operation. like default drag image. which shows during dragging.

    5. addElement(element)
        - It used to add an element to the drag operation.
        - Using this method, we can add multiple elements to be dragged together.
        - Example: dragging multiple files from desktop.

    <=====> Properties <=====>

    1. dropEffect
        - It tell the browser what kind of operation is performed when a dragged item is dropped.
        - It does not perform the action; it's just a hint to the browser. which helps to show appropriate cursor.
        - Possible values are "none", "copy", "link", and "move".

    2. effectAllowed
        - It is similar to "dropEffect", but it specifies the allowed operations for the drag source.
        - It tells the browser what operations are allowed for the dragged data.
        - Possible values are "none", "copy", "link", "move", "copy link", "copyMove", "linkMove", and "all" and combine them with space.
        - Drag won't works if "effectAllowed" and "dropEffect" are not compatible.
        - Suppose if "effectAllowed" is set to "copy" and "dropEffect" is set to "move", drag won't works.

    3. files
        - It used to get a list of files being dragged.
        - It returns a "FileList" object containing the files.

    4. items
        - It used to get a list of items being dragged.
        - It returns a "DataTransferItemList" object containing the items.
        - It is a new way to retrieve, add, and remove the data being dragged.

        5. types
        - It used to get a list of the formats of the data that is stored in the
        "DataTransfer" object.
        - It returns a "DOMStringList" object containing the formats.

    ============== DROP TARGET ==============

    - A drop target is an element where user can drop a draggable item.
    - By default, most elements are not drop targets, to make them drop targets we have to cancel the default behavior of "dragover" event by using "event.preventDefault()" method.
    - Than it will allow the element to accept drop.
    - "drop" event only fires on drop targets.
